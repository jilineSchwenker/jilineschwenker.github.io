      <h1> “I build things to understand them. And sometimes, to surprise myself.” </h1>
      <p> I'm a CS student at the University of Tuebingen. 
          Throughout my studies, I aim to understand how computers work and explore the fascinating world of CS. 
          Currently, I'm working on improving in HTML and CSS and if you're reading this, you've just become part of my learning journey.
          Follow me along as I discover the creative power of code.
